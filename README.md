# Big-Data-Project

This is a Course project for CS570 Big Data Processing and Analytics. <br>

Under the scope of the course work project, we are required to present implementation of one of the taught concepts to satisfy the course project requirements. <br>

I used **Lending Club** historical dataset for analysis and modeling. This is an open-source dataset from lending club, which contains complete loan data for all
the loan issued through 2007-2015. <br>

The peer-to-peer lending industry has grown significantly since its inception in 2007. With billions in annual loans, there are significant opportunities to capitalize
on this alternative investment instrument. 

### Objective
I have developed a sophisticated learning model to bolster investment strategy that utilizes Lending Club Corporation’s massive historical datasets to understand which features best predict someone’s
probability of defaulting loan. 

To model the default loan prediction, I have used 4 machine learning algorithms/techniques 

- Logistic Regression
- Naïve Bayers
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting Classifier. 
and implemented them using big data distributed computing frameworks. 

**Technology Specs**: findSpark 3.2.1, pySpark 3.2.1, Spark 3.2.1, Spark MLlib,
Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, Python programming, Seaborn, pyplot libraries,
sklearn

### Result

If Lending Club must provide the more precise information to the investors to
reduce their investment risk, they need to provide the default likeliness of borrower
more accurately. Should this model be used in real life, the goal of this project is to
retain more investors for Lending Club. Therefore, more focus is put on precision
and specificity of the model.
